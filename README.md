#   Advent of Code 2022

Fish is my absolute favorite shell.  It has all the features you'd expect from
a modern shell (and more!), and scripting in Fish is a breeze.

That being said, Fish is definitely a scripting language and not particularly
suited to general programming problems.  I think attempting AoC 2022 in Fish
should be quite a fun challenge!
